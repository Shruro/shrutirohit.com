<p>On that day Shruti was going to her home from hostel, Rohit had holiday, as he used to travel from home daily to college, she thought, he had not come that day to College.
But on that day, to give her surprise he had come and was oftenly asking her where she was, she did get that doubt but was not sure, when get down in the city bus stand, she saw him, yes it was him.
Both were stunned at the moment as till that day, they never saw each other's face so closely, and they never spoke standing face-to-face.
They got bus and sat, fun thing was there were 3 seats and she sat on windows seat, and leaving one seat next to her Rohit sat.
Fortunately one Uncle came and asked Rohit to move so that he can sit on that vacant middle seat, but Rohit moved to that vacant seat, finally sat next to his LOVE.
In the bus they hardly spoke,but enjoyed each other's presence.
In the bus he gave her chocolate, her favorite, she sat eating that in the whole journey
and Yes, that chocolate Wrapper and ticket is still with them.</p>

<p style = "font-size: 25px;"><em><strong>"That fear at the beginning of the meeting, which is called nervousness, never felt before and that sadness at the end when we were sayinh bye to each other , should never come"</em></strong></p>

Shruti was wearing white colour kurta and Rohit was wearing light pink shirt.
Again Rohit was there near the lake before Shruti and this time too with Chocolate.
They sat together in the banks of lake.
Rohit made her to look away and then he kissed on her cheek, she was stunned and he was almost sweat.
Sat together holding each other's hand, it was the heavenly moment moment for them.
He dropped her to hostel on bike.
Throughtout the ride, she was asking him ride slow as she did not want to go to hostel leaving him so soon, but he wanted her to reach hostel early and safely</p>

      They reached the Resort before it opens, so they roamed there in kajoo farm and had some romantic moments, they were speaking so much that even Rohit's friend who also came along with them with his girl could hear their voice.
      Once the Resort opened, they moved in and kept walking toeards one so called waterfalls, where there was hardly they could see waterüòÖ
     then they occupied one table and keep talking, meanwhile had some romantic moments too, then had lunchin their own way.
     Shruti walked on the foot of Rohit's.She sat on his lap.Then he dropped her to hostel, and while going back she hugged him on bike, which increased his body temperature.
